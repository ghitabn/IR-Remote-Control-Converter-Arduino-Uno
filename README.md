# Infrared Remote Control Converter (Arduino Uno)

## 1. Description

This project shows how to build an infrared remote control (IR RC) converter that allows emulating an IR remote control (emulated IR RC) using a different one (physical IR RC). The basic principle is the following: IR codes sent by the physical IR RC are intercepted by an IR receiver, translated into the physical IR RC corresponding codes and sent through an IR transmitter. The translation table that maps the physical to emulated IR RC codes is permanently stored in the microcontroller’s internal EEPROM; it can be easily (re)initialized by putting the system in setup mode (hardware interrupt generated by a button press).

Difficulty level: advanced.

Notes
1. The code below has been tested for IR RC conversions between NEC, JVC and Samsung IR RCs. Other conversions might be possible by uncommenting the corresponding lines in the switch instruction (loop function).
2. The translation table that maps the physical to emulated IR RC codes is permanently stored in the microcontroller’s internal EEPROM; it can be easily (re)initialized by putting the system in setup mode (hardware interrupt generated by a button press). During the normal operation it is loaded into the SRAM memory for faster access.
